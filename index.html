    <p>What is Docker</p>

    <p>A container platform is complete solution that allows organizations to solve multiple problems across a diverse set of
      requirements. It is more than a piece of technology and orchestration - it delivers sustainable benefits throughout your
      organization by providing all the pieces an enterprise operation requires including security, governance, automation,
      support and certification over the entire application lifecycle.</p>

    <p>Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every application
      across the hybrid cloud.
      <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;
      <a data-linktype="external" href="https://github.com/docker/docker">open-source project</a>&nbsp;for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that
      can run on the cloud or on-premises. Docker is also a&nbsp;
      <a data-linktype="external" href="https://www.docker.com/">company</a>&nbsp;that promotes and evolves this technology. Docker works in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and Windows
      vendors, including Microsoft. Docker image containers run natively on Linux and Windows. Windows images run only on Windows
      hosts and Linux images run only on Linux hosts. The host is a server or a VM.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>The company&rsquo;s main product Docker</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program" title="Computer program">computer program</a>&nbsp;that performs&nbsp;
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization" title="Operating-system-level virtualization">operating-system-level virtualization</a>&nbsp;also known as&nbsp;
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization" title="Operating-system-level virtualization">containerization</a>.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The Docker software as a service offering consists of three components:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Software:</strong>&nbsp;The Docker&nbsp;
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)" title="Daemon (computing)">daemon</a>, called&nbsp;&quot;dockerd&quot;&nbsp;is a persistent process that manages Docker containers and handles
        container objects. The daemon listens for API requests sent by the Docker Engine API. The Docker client, which identifies
        itself as&nbsp;&quot;docker&quot;, allows users to interact with Docker through CLI. It uses the Docker REST API to
        communicate with one or more Docker daemons.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Objects:</strong>&nbsp;Docker objects refer to different entities used to assemble an application in Docker. The main
        Docker objects are images, containers, and services.

        <ul>
          <li>A Docker container is a standardized, encapsulated environment that runs applications. A container is managed using
            the Docker API or CLI.</li>
          <li>A Docker image is a read-only template used to build containers. Images are used to store and ship applications</li>
          <li>A Docker service allows containers to be scaled across multiple Docker daemons. The result is known as a &quot;swarm&quot;,
            cooperating daemons that communicate through the Docker API.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Registries:</strong>&nbsp;A Docker registry is a repository for Docker images. Docker clients connect to registries
        to download (&quot;pull&quot;) images for use or upload (&quot;push&quot;) images that they have built. Registries
        can be public or private. Two main public registries are Docker Hub and Docker Cloud. Docker Hub is the default registry
        where Docker looks for images.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What is Nginx</p>

    <p>
      <strong>NGINX</strong>&nbsp;is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming,
      and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server
      capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load
      balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.</p>

    <p>Nginx accelerates content and application delivery, improves security, facilitates availability and scalability&nbsp;for
      the busiest websites on the Internet.</p>

    <p>In other terms, Nginx is just a kind of software which is used in web servers to serve&nbsp;the concurrent requests. Previously
      we used to install Apache in web servers to handle these functions; but as the world is growing and demanding more things
      at one time the term concurrency comes into the picture and Nginx launched for the same thing.</p>

    <p>Nginx can be deployed to serve dynamic&nbsp;
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP" title="HTTP">HTTP</a>&nbsp;content on the network using&nbsp;
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI" title="FastCGI">FastCGI</a>,&nbsp;

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phusion_Passenger" title="Phusion Passenger">Phusion Passenger</a>&nbsp;modules, and it can serve as a software&nbsp;
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)">load balancer</a>
    </p>

    <p>Nginx follows event-based process; it does not create individual thread of request for each process like Apache does, but
      smartly follows events of a process.&nbsp;Below is the demonstration of a Nginx server handling concurrent MP3 and MP4
      file requests.</p>

    <p>Nginx divided its job into Worker Connections and Worker Process. Here worker connections are managing the request made
      and the response obtained by users on the web server; in the same time these request are passed to its parent process
      which is Worker Process. A single worker connection&nbsp;(See in Diagram: Worker Connections) can handle around 1024
      connections at a time. It is the greatest ability of a worker connection. There can &ldquo;n&rdquo; numbers of the worker
      process in Nginx based on the type of server you have and each worker process handle different jobs so that it can handle
      more numbers of concurrent requests. Finally, the worker process transfers the requests to Nginx Master Process which
      quickly responds to the unique requests only.</p>

    <p>Nginx is Asynchronous; that means each request in Nginx can be executed concurrently without blocking each other like a
      water pipe. So this way Nginx enhances the virtually shared resources without being dedicated and blocked to one connection.That
      is why Nginx is able to do the same work with less amount of memory and utilizes that memory in an optimized way.</p>

    <p>What is VM (virtual machine)</p>

    <p>A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. In other words,
      creating a computer within a computer. It runs in a window, much like any other program, giving the end user the same
      experience on a virtual machine as they would have on the host operating system itself. The virtual machine is sandboxed
      from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a virtual machine can&rsquo;t escape or tamper with the
      computer itself. This produces an ideal environment for testing other operating systems including beta releases, accessing
      virus-infected data, creating operating system backups, and running software or applications on operating systems they
      weren&rsquo;t originally intended for.</p>

    <p>Multiple virtual machines can run simultaneously on the same physical computer. For servers, the multiple operating systems
      run side-by-side with a piece of software called a hypervisor to manage them, while desktop computers typical employ
      one operating system to run the other operating systems within its program windows. Each virtual machine provides its
      own virtual hardware, including CPUs, memory, hard drives, network interfaces, and other devices. The virtual hardware
      is then then mapped to the real hardware on the physical machine which saves costs by reducing the need for physical
      hardware systems along with the associated maintenance costs that go with it, plus reduces power and cooling demand</p>

    <p>There are different kinds of virtual machines, each with different functions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>System virtual machines (also termed&nbsp;
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_virtualization" title="Full virtualization">full virtualization</a>&nbsp;VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide functionality needed to execute

        one another, yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use&nbsp;

      <li>Process virtual machines are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</p>

    <p>
      <strong>DigitalOcean, Inc.</strong>&nbsp;is an&nbsp;
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" title="Americas">American</a>&nbsp;
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" title="Cloud computing">cloud</a>&nbsp;infrastructure provider. DigitalOcean provides developers cloud services that help to deploy and scale
      applications that run simultaneously on multiple computers. As of December 2016, DigitalOcean was the second largest&nbsp;
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service" title="Web hosting service">hosting</a>&nbsp;company in the world in terms of web-facing computers.</p>

    <p>To deploy DigitalOcean&#39;s Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment, developers launch a private virtual machine
      (
      <a href="https://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-machine">VM</a>)&nbsp;instance, which DigitalOcean calls a &quot;droplet.&quot; Developers choose the droplet&#39;s size, which
      geographical region and data center it will run in, and which Linux operating system it will use:&nbsp;
      <a href="https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/Ubuntu">Ubuntu</a>, CentOS,&nbsp;
      <a href="https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/Debian">Debian</a>,&nbsp;
      <a href="https://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/definition/Fedora">Fedora</a>, CoreOS or&nbsp;
      <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a>.&nbsp;
      <a href="https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Secure-Shell">Secure Shell (SSH)</a>&nbsp;is also supported for secure communication.&nbsp;Instead of picking a Linux distribution,
      developers can also create droplets from existing VM images that come with pre-installed applications -- an option DigitalOcean
      calls &quot;One-click Apps.&quot;</p>

    <p>DigitalOcean offers nine droplet sizes. The smallest size starts at 512MB of&nbsp;
      <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/reference/Fast-Guide-to-RAM">RAM</a>&nbsp;with 1&nbsp;
      <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/processor">CPU</a>and 20GB of solid state drive (
      <a href="https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/SSD-solid-state-drive">SSD</a>) storage, and as of this writing costs $5 a month. The largest droplet size is 64GB of RAM with 20 CPUs and 640GB
      of SSD storage and as of this writing costs $640 a month. Developers have the option of resizing their droplets after
      creating them.</p>

    <p>Developers use the DigitalOcean&nbsp;manage and monitor their droplets with a&nbsp;control panel and an&nbsp;open source&nbsp;
      <a href="https://searchmicroservices.techtarget.com/definition/application-program-interface-API">API</a>. The control panel allows developers to scale and rebuild droplets based on workload changes and perform&nbsp;
      <a href="https://searchdatabackup.techtarget.com/definition/backup">backups</a>&nbsp;and redirect network traffic between droplets. A feature called Team Accounts is available to establish
      resource-sharing between different DigitalOcean users.</p>
